do entire process in ansible

use vagrant to provision 2 multiple virtual machines. create virtual private connection between VMs and test with rsync

configure docker and docker local network and do the same with vagrant above^

host dockerized services within virtual machines for ircd, teamspeak server, website, database, bybit trading bot that spams 1 dollar orders, and who-is app!

reverse proxy the shit for site

for the website/application layer use jenkins pipeline to continiously integrate git and deploy automatically every x minutes

Install Nagios on Virtual Machines

write a python script to take system level logs from vagrant VMs and email them to hayabusaninja@cocaine.ninja every 24 hours (use cronjobs)

or nagios output somewhere? idk

create a python script. in the python script invoke some OS commands, use tuples, dicts, hashmaps, and send an email in python within a function

make a cron job to run the script to do the things every x minutes
